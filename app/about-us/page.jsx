            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Welcome! Weâ€™re here to help keep <strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong> strong and share its teachings with children.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Our journey began at the <em>Brambhika Sametha Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple</em> in Nandikandi village. Every year at our <strong>Dasara Pooja</strong>, we give <strong>sloka books</strong> to children, teaching them about shlokas and their meanings.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              These books help children learn shlokas, understand them, and know when to recite them. Through this, they connect with our culture and learn values like peace and respect.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Thank you for joining us on this journey to keep our traditions alive!

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We received a lot of love and requests for more sloka books. Families wanted shlokas in different languages so more children could learn. To make it easier for everyone to access these books, we created this website.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Now, families everywhere can read and learn shlokas in their own language. This website gives translations, meanings, and guides for reciting shlokas, helping families connect with these sacred verses from home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We hope this website helps keep the spirit of Sanatana Dharma strong and brings families together. Together, let's pass down our traditions for generations to come.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Thank you for being a part of this journey. We hope these shlokas bring peace and blessings to your life.
